		<p class="left-column"><b>Entrance Requirements</b>
			<br><br><br>
			
			<b>College Eligibility</b>
			<br><br>
			Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) or equivalent. Applicants with an OSSD showing senior English and/or Mathematics courses at the Basic Level, or with Workplace or Open courses, will be tested to determine their eligibility for admission; OR<br><br>
			Academic and Career Entrance (ACE) certificate; OR<br><br>
			General Educational Development (GED) certificate; OR<br><br>
			Mature Student status (19 years of age or older and without a high school diploma at the start of the program). Eligibility may be determined by academic achievement testing for which a fee of $50 (subject to change) will be charged.<br><br>
			<br><b>Program Eligibility</b>
			<br><br>
			English, Grade 12 (ENG4C or equivalent).<br><br>
			Mathematics, (Grade 12 MCT4C) or (Grade 11 MCR3U) or equivalent; or (Grade 12 MAP4C with a grade of 80% or higher) or (Grade 11 MCF3M with a grade of 70% or higher).<br><br>
			Applicants with international transcripts must provide proof of the subject specific requirements noted above and may be required to provide proof of language proficiency. Domestic applicants with international transcripts must be evaluated through the International Credential Assessment Service of Canada (ICAS) or World Education Services (WES).<br><br>
			IELTS-International English Language Testing Service (Academic) Overall band of 6.0 with a minimum of 5.5 in each band; OR TOEFL-Internet-based (iBT)-overall 80, with a minimum of 20 in each component: Reading: 20; Listening: 20; Speaking: 20; Writing: 20.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p class="right-column"><b>Other Diploma Requirements</b><br>
		<b>General Education Elective</b><br><br>
		Students choose one course, from a group of general education electives, which meets one of the following four theme requirements: Arts in Society, Civic Life, Social and Cultural Understanding, and Science and Technology.<br><br><br>
		<b>Choose one of two electives</b><br><br><br>
		<b>Project I</b><br><br>
		Experience with practical projects provides students with learning opportunities to gain insight and experience, thereby making the connection to industry. Through collaborative participation in applied research projects, students in groups undertake problems of significant technical complexity and work towards solutions using project management methodologies. Student groups initiate projects working closely with stakeholders in real-world workplace environments. There is an option to take the project course ENG4002 as an equivalence to this course. Note: the project courses (ENG4001 and ENG4003) and the supporting communication courses (ENL4001 and ENL4003) have to be done in two consecutive terms.<br><br><br>
		<b>Engineering Project for Entrepreneurs</b><br><br>
		Experiencing the process of creating and validating a new product or service idea provides students with the opportunity to decide whether the path of an entrepreneur is suited to them. Through the processes of ideation and customer idea validation, students continue to refine an idea until it is ready to pitch to investors. Students with successful pitches earn funds to build their prototype the following term in ENG4003.

			<b>Description of First of Three Year Advanced Diploma Program Courses</b>
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Computer Essentials</b>
			<br><br>
			The essentials of computer software, hardware, and laptop management form the foundation for building further technical programming skills. Learn to configure your laptop environment, basic PC and troubleshoot problems. Create backups, install virus protection, and manage files through a basic understanding of the Windows Operating System. Install and configure the Windows Operating System, and a virtual machine environment. Explore computer organization including basic numerical systems, functional hardware and software components needed to run programs.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Introduction to Computer Programming</b>
			<br><br>
			Students receive an introduction to computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML class diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Instruction in the Java programming language is provided including an introduction to object oriented programming, sequential structure, selection structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Introduction to Database</b>
			<br><br>
			Students learn the fundamentals of Relational Databases design using Entity Relation diagrams,and use SQL to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using   Normalization. Students are able to compare and appreciate a Database Management System (DBMS)and its components with legacy systems.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Achieving Success in Changing Environments</b>
			<br><br>
			Rapid changes in technology have created personal and employment choices that challenge each of us to find our place as contributing citizens in the emerging society. Life in the 21st century presents significant opportunities, but it also creates potential hazards and ethical problems that demand responsible solutions. Students explore the possibilities ahead, assess their own aptitudes and strengths, and apply critical thinking and decision-making tools to help resolve some of the important issues in our complex society with its competing interests. 
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Communications I</b>
			<br><br>
			Communication remains an essential skill sought by employers, regardless of discipline or field of study. Using a practical, vocation-oriented approach, students focus on meeting the requirements of effective communication. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and independent learning, students practise writing, speaking, reading, listening, locating and documenting information and using technology to communicate professionally. Students develop and strengthen communication skills that contribute to success in both educational and workplace environments.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Technical Mathematics for Computer Science</b>
			<br><br>
			The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus. Students manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems and learn the properties of and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. Students also study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent to the completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and L.

		<p class="footer"><b>Careers</b><br>
		Graduates may find employment as systems, integration, and applications programmers and/or testers, and as customer service representatives providing training and product support to clients of high technology corporations. Graduates may also pursue careers in such diverse areas as game and multimedia development; GUI (graphical user interface) development; IT communications, IT security, real-time and database systems; web-based applications; and technical roles in all levels of government (federal, provincial and municipal).<p>
